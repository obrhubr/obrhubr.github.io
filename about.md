Hey, my name is Niklas and I am a developer from Austria and I want to study computer science at ETHZ.

I like coding, neural networks, Gödel Escher Bach, sociology, writing, model airplanes, fountain pens and champagne.

### Acknowledgements

The first version of my site's design is heavily inspired by [James Haydon's Blog](https://jameshaydon.github.io), which I loved and discovered through hackernews.

I could also not have done this without the great [notion2md](https://github.com/echo724/notion2md) project.
