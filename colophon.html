    This page is built using Jekyll - see the full source code under <a href="https://github.com/obrhubr/obrhubr.github.io">obrhubr/obrhubr.github.io</a>.
    All content is fully accessible without Javascript, which is only used to display image's alt-text.

<h2>Design</h2>
<p>
    The design of the site is inspired by <a href="https://michael.orlitzky.com/">Michael Orlitzky's</a> site.
</p>
<p>
    The content is edited on Notion and then pulled into a markdown document using a custom built tool based on <a href="https://github.com/echo724/notion2md">notion2md</a>. 
    If you want to use this tool too, you can! 
    Head over to the repository at <a href="https://github.com/obrhubr/notion-to-jekyll">obrhubr/notion-to-jekyll</a> - you can customise it to fit your use-case with the provided command line options.
